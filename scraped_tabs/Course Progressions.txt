Sample Full-Time Schedule
Prequarter
• 5 Weeks
Optional
Introduction to Statistical Concepts (Foundational)
Optional
This course is held in the 5 weeks leading up to the start of your first quarter and provides general exposure to basic statistical concepts that are necessary for students to understand the content presented in more advanced courses in the program. 0 units, no cost.
R for Data Science (Foundational)
Optional
This course is held in the 5 weeks leading up to the start of your first quarter and is an introduction to the essential concepts and techniques for the statistical computing language R. 0 units, no cost.
Quarter 1
• 10 Weeks
Optional
Python for Data Science (Foundational)
Optional
This course is held concurrently with the first five weeks of your first quarter in the program and starts with an introduction to the Python programming language basic syntax and environment. 0 units, no cost.
Advanced Linear Algebra for Machine Learning (Foundational)

If you are required to take this course it will be held concurrently with the second five weeks of your first quarter in the program. The advanced linear algebra course is focused on the theoretical concepts and real-life applications of linear algebra for machine learning. 0 units, no cost.
Core
Statistical Models for Data Science
Letter Grade
In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.
Core
Leadership and Consulting for Data Science
Letter Grade
Professional organizations see value in data science when it helps them to achieve their strategic goals, and the current job market likewise rewards data scientists who can use data to advance organizational interests, either as an external consultant or within internal operations teams. Data scientists can become successful (and highly marketable) leaders in today’s professional world, but they require an uncommon skill set: the strategic awareness to align data requirements with business requirements, the technical proficiency to choose a methodology appropriate to each new problem, and the communication skills to both execute the plan as part of a broader team and persuade others of their findings.
Core (Choose 1)
Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing
Letter Grade
Data Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market. Big Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications. There is no single definition of big data and multiple emerging software packages exist to work with it, and we will cover the most popular approaches.
Seminar
Career Seminar (Required)
Pass/Fail
The Career Seminar (Pass/Fail) supports the development of industry professional skills, job and/or internship searches, and other in-demand areas of competency among today’s employers. Students enroll in the Career Seminar each quarter in order to engage in unique content throughout their degree program. Students with significant full-time work experience may be eligible to waive this course. 0 units, no cost.
Quarter 2
• 10 Weeks
Core
Machine Learning I
Letter Grade
This course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It gives a rigorous methodological foundation in analytical and software tools to successfully undertake projects in Data Science. Students are exposed to concepts of exploratory analyses for uncovering and detecting patterns in multivariate data, hypothesizing and detecting relationships among variables, conducting confirmatory analyses, and building models for predictive and descriptive purposes. It will present predictive modeling in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracies.
